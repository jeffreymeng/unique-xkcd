# Unread XKCD

A chrome extension that adds a "Random Unread" button to the xkcd website that allows you to view a random xkcd that you've never seen before.

Note: this extension currently doesn't look at your _past_ history, so it can only make sure that when you click the "Random Unread" button, you don't see any xkcd comics that you've seen before _while the extension has been active_.
